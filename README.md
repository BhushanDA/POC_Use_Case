# *Hackathon Problem Statement for UNILIVER*
Finding the Drivers affecting sales of a Product and Forecasting sales for next 6 periods 

# *Description*
•	One of the companies is launching a new product so we need to find major drivers for sales (EQ) and knowing the drivers, how accurately we can predict future sales for next 6 periods.\
•	Firstly Training data is converted into periodic with having 428 periods. Exploratory data analysis is completed on that data. After that major drivers are extracted on the basis of score by using Boruta and Random forest algorithm is done in R programming. Forecasting is done using Multivariate algorithm.\
•	From the forecast it is observed that there is a downward trend in sales.
